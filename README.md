# Home
Home is an all-in-one software solution that allows users to customize their home panel to tackle specific home chores effectively! Every widget is a self-contained assistant for tackling a very particular chore/task. This design makes it very easy to break up each widget as a microservice. The idea is not ground-breaking, it's not the next biggest thing, but it's an opportunity to build a platform that scales with developers that love to build useful tools for people, even when they already exist.

# Job Hunt
The first of many microservices is JobHunt, a .NET microservice for querying and saving the user's job applications in AWS DynamoDB. At the moment, the type of applications applies to mostly Software Engineer/Developer positions. Home allows the open-source community to add their own microservices using whatever technologies they feel are most beneficial for the task.
